# Software Requirements Engineering

This repository contains all the materials related to the CSC 436 Software Requirements Engineering course. The primary project was to create a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an unnamed car's Rear Collision Avoidance System.

## Project Overview

Our task involved the following activities:

- **KAOS Diagrams**: Knowledge, Attitude, Objective, Strategy (KAOS) diagrams were used to systematically identify and structure the system goals.

- **UML Class Diagrams**: These diagrams provided a comprehensive view of the system's structure, showing the classes in the system, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among objects.

- **State Machine Diagrams**: State machine diagrams depicted the various states of functions within the system and the transitions between those states. 

- **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**: An analysis was performed to identify possible failures in the system, their causes and effects, and the measures needed to mitigate them.

All these components were vital in constructing a complete and robust SRS that adheres to industry standards.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

The completed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is available in this repository. It effectively outlines all the necessary information regarding the system's requirements, as per standard practices in requirements engineering. The SRS provides a detailed description of the system's functionality, performance, design constraints, and other necessary attributes to offer complete insight into what the system is expected to do.

This repository provides a practical example of the software requirements engineering process, illustrating the application of various techniques and principles in defining and documenting software requirements.
